openprog firmware

This is a fork of the firmware section of Alberto Maccioni's openprog project (http://openprog.altervista.org/). The primary goal is to provide a version that can be built in MPLAB X with the XC8 compiler, as the previous development environent used MCC which is no longer supported. This has been achieved and therefore I am releasing the code here under GPLv3.

The change history may be helpful to others looking to port code from MCC to XC8.

The firmware is only intended to support the PIC18F25K50 chip, but some support code for other chips remains.

The following chips have been tested:
12F609
12F1572
